# Video x264 Analyzer

x264 encoder and decoder
Small library using SDL2 and webassembly to analyze video stream and  plot points into a 2D graph at webpages
It renders graph using webassemply at HTML5 canvas. Which makes it very fast.
It displays video, FFT, DCT,  SNR, frame by frame analysis, structure similarity and object similarity

Please keep in mind I am not the author of x264 encdoer, I have just made x264 easy to understand and debug. Also, I am sharing my x264 decoder source code. It plots the graphs and help in visualisation of the video frame. Also it helps in boosting performance and bug fixes. Also I have fixed broken x264 decoder, which helps in understanding encoder and decoder.

I am a big admirer of Laurent Aimar, original author of x264.
